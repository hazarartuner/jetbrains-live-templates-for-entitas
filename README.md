## Jetbrains Live Templates for [Entitas-CSharp](https://github.com/sschmid/Entitas-CSharp#readme)

Hi,

I use Rider IDE for coding. And I noticed that there is no available live templates for Entitas or I couldn't find it. So I've created these code templates and want to share them.

## Setup
1. Download the [settings file](./download/settings.zip)
2. Open JetBrains Rider
3. Choose File | Import Settings from the menu.
4. Choose the `settings.zip` file that you downloaded
5. In the Import Settings dialog, select the Live templates checkbox and click OK.

*If you have an issue with importing these settings, follow the instructions from JetBrains Rider's official website:
